  A parent Employee class module is created with name, id and email constructors, then the child classes Engineer, Manager, and Intern extend from that with each one having a unique contructor of their own. The modules are exported and referenced in the app.js file and used in unison with node inquirer to gather user info and generate html specific to the employee's role. In the future I plan to add validation to make sure whatever the user is inputting is 'allowed'; right now it defaults to the Employee class.

  ## Installation
  To install, you just need to download the files, go into your terminal and make sure you're in the right directory and you have node.js installed, then run 'npm i'. That should install all modules. 

  ## Usage
  In the same directory as the app.js file, type 'node app.js' in your terminal to run the program. Answer the employee question prompts.
